## [v0.4.0] — 2026-06-19 (Activity Subsystem Design)

### Activity Event Schema (Task A001)

First architectural milestone for the Activity subsystem — a new event-driven
pipeline for ingesting device activity and triggering autonomous Claude awareness.

- **`docs/activity/SCHEMA.md`**: Comprehensive event schema documentation
  - Unified event contract: version, id, timestamp, source, collector, device, type, payload, raw
  - Hierarchical dot-notation naming convention (`device.awake`, `battery.low`, …)
  - 12 reserved event domains, 25+ typed event types defined
  - Payload sub-schemas for every event type (DeviceAwakePayload, BatteryLowPayload, …)
  - Design principles: source agnostic, normalize late, schema-versioned, typed payload
  - Future extension strategy for new sources, collectors, and event types
- **`activity/types.ts`**: TypeScript type contract
  - `ActivityEvent<T>` — discriminated union with typed payload per event type
  - `EventPayload<T>` — maps each `EventType` to its specific payload interface
  - 25+ payload sub-schemas with full TypeScript type safety
  - Extensible `EventType` and `EventCollector` types (string union with escape hatch)

### Documentation Updates

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Added Activity Subsystem section with pipeline diagram and component table
- `ROADMAP.md`: Added Phase 7 (Background Automation) + Phase 8 (Activity Subsystem) + updated Long-Term Vision diagram
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`: Restructured (Hub Module → Repository Structure), added Activity Subsystem section, updated components + task table
- `CHANGELOG.md`: This entry

### Design Decisions

- Activity is a **separate subsystem**, not an MCP service. It has its own pipeline (Gateway → Normalizer → Database → Decision → Trigger).
- The **Event Contract** is defined before any implementation — schema-first, documentation-first.
- **`raw` is always preserved** alongside normalized `payload` — enables re-processing and debugging.
- **IDs are ULID-based** (`evt_<ulid>`) — time-sortable, globally unique, generated server-side by the Gateway.
- Extension is purely additive: new event types, sources, and collectors require zero breaking changes.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-06-18 (Claude Web Connected)

### First End-to-End Closed Loop

Claude Web Connector successfully connected to MCP Hub. This is the first
version where Claude (the AI) can discover and invoke tools through the Hub
over the standard MCP Streamable HTTP protocol.

- **Claude Web Connector** connected to `https://raven-victor.click/mcp`
- Auth mode: `none` (Claude Web has no Bearer Token input field)
- Protocol: MCP Streamable HTTP 2024-11-05 (via FastMCP 1.28.0)
- Transport: ASGI middleware proxy (zero-buffer SSE passthrough)
- 7 tools across 3 servers auto-discovered
- DEBUG protocol logging active (request/response dump)
- `docs/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md`: documented AUTH_MODE=none/bearer/oauth

`v0.3.0` — MCP Hub successfully connected with Claude Connector

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-06-18 (Production Deployed)

### Task-016 — MCP Auth (Bearer Token) ✅

- `src/core/auth.py`: FastAPI dependency that validates `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Token configured via `MCP_HUB_AUTH_TOKEN` env var; empty = auth disabled
- POST /mcp requires valid token when configured; REST endpoints always public
- Wrong/missing token → HTTP 401 + JSON-RPC error body (code -32003)
- Per-request token resolution — no import-time caching, test-safe
- `tests/test_auth.py`: 9 tests covering all scenarios
- Total: 166 tests passing

### Task-013 — Claude Desktop End-to-End Integration ✅

- 12/12 end-to-end tests passed over HTTPS + Bearer Token
- Verified: initialize, tools/list, tools/call (global + server-scoped)
- Ombre: health (CONNECTED), status — external deployment reachable
- ntfy: health (ok), info, send (200) — real push notification sent
- example: ping (pong) — Hub pipeline fully functional
- Claude Desktop config guide: `docs/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md`
- E2E report: `docs/task013/E2E_REPORT.md`
- Zero Core changes — Hub architecture stable throughout

### Task-012 — Domain + HTTPS + Cloudflare ✅

**Domain:** `raven-victor.click`  
**VPS:** `45.76.169.98`  
**Status:** Deployed and verified

**Endpoints (all HTTPS):**
- `GET /health` → `{"status":"healthy","total_servers":3,...}`
- `GET /status` → `{"version":"0.1.0","runtime":"mcp-hub",...}`
- `POST /mcp` → JSON-RPC 2.0 (initialize, tools/list, tools/call)

**Infrastructure:**
- Caddy: Let's Encrypt certificate (acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org)
- Cloudflare: DNS A record (45.76.169.98), SSL Full (strict)
- Docker: ai-caddy + ai-mcp-hub (2 containers, 3 Python adapters)

**Fixes during deployment:**
- Removed broken ombre-mcp/ntfy-mcp Docker stubs (external services, loaded by Hub discovery)
- Fixed discovery.py auto-detect for Docker flat layout (3 vs 4 directory levels)
- Added CADDY_ACME_EMAIL + DOMAIN environment variables to Caddy container
- 157/157 tests passing

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-06-18

### Architecture Consistency Audit (Pre-Deployment)

**Docker Compose:**
- Fixed stale `# TODO: implement` comments on ombre-mcp and ntfy-mcp (both implemented: Task-009, Task-010)
- Fixed env var names: `OMBRE_API_URL` → `OMBRE_ENDPOINT` (matches manifest.yaml and adapter)
- Commented out filesystem-mcp and github-mcp — reserved, no source code yet
- Updated caddy and cloudflared comments to reflect current state

**Documentation:**
- `docs/MCP.md`: Updated Ombre status (Planned → ✅ Integrated, Task-009), ntfy (Planned → ✅ Integrated, Task-010), Filesystem/GitHub (Reserved)
- `caddy/README.md`: Fixed misleading `/$DOMAIN/mcp` → correctly describes `/mcp`, `/health`, `/status`, `/tools` proxy paths
- `docs/task012/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`: Added HTTPS-Only Enforcement section (Always Use HTTPS, HSTS, Automatic HTTPS Rewrites)

**Code:**
- `base_server.py`: Fixed subclass docstring — OmbreServer/NtfyServer no longer marked "future", now "implemented"

**Governance:**
- `docs/SPECIFICATION.md`: Added §9 Definition of Completed (5 gates) + §10 Review Gate (7-step pipeline)
- `CLAUDE.md`: Added Completed definition + Task Transition Pipeline

### Task-012 — Domain + HTTPS + Cloudflare

**Status:** Implemented — pending real domain binding

**Deliverables:**
- `caddy/Caddyfile`: Auto HTTPS reverse proxy (`/mcp`, `/health`, `/status`, `/tools` → `mcp-hub:8080`)
- `caddy/README.md`: Configuration guide with DOMAIN and CADDY_ACME_EMAIL vars
- `docs/task012/DOMAIN_SETUP.md`: DNS A record setup (Cloudflare + direct)
- `docs/task012/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md`: SSL/TLS, proxy, Cloudflare Tunnel, HTTPS-Only
- `docs/task012/HTTPS_VALIDATION.md`: 5-step HTTPS validation checklist
- `docs/task012/TASK012_REPORT.md`: Architecture overview and deployment steps
- `scripts/verify_https.sh`: Automated HTTPS + MCP endpoint verification
- `cloudflare/tunnel-config.yaml`: Tunnel ingress rules template
- `.env.example`: Updated with DOMAIN, CADDY_ACME_EMAIL, Cloudflare vars

**Pending for Task-013:**
- Purchase/configure real domain
- Point DNS A record to VPS IP
- Set up Cloudflare with Full SSL/TLS
- Deploy `docker compose up -d` on VPS
- Verify with `scripts/verify_https.sh`
- Wire Claude Desktop to `https://<domain>/mcp`
